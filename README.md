# re:Scan
re:Scan (Resume Scanner) is a Chrome extension that provides a detailed report on how well-tailored an applicant's resume is to a particular job description.


## Background
A well-tailored resume is an essential aspect to a successful job application. However, crafting such a resume can be difficult and time-consuming.

re:Scan seeks to simplify the resume tailoring process by providing instant feed back on resume and job description similarity. It parses through a job description to isolate specific hard and soft qualities an employer is looking for. It then parses through an applicant's resumes looking for key words that suggest an applicant possesses these qualities. A percentage score that reflects how well a resume is suited for a job description is consequently produced. If an applicant's resume highly reflects the qualities an employer is looking for, a high percentage score is given. Otherwise, a low percentage score along with suggested verbs is provided.

Applicants should be able to upload their resume to the extension. This resume should persist through browser navigation and be easily accessed upon clicking the Chrome extension button. The extension will parse through the DOM to look for job description text.
